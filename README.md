# ZipcodeInfo 

Summary
Created a .NET Web API that takes ZIP-code as a parameter, then outputs city name, current temperature, time zone, and general elevation at the location with a user-friendly message. For example, “At the location $CITY_NAME, the temperature is $TEMPERATURE, the timezone is $TIMEZONE, and the elevation is $ELEVATION”. 

Used the Open WeatherMap current weather API to retrieve the current temperature and city name. 
Used the Google Time Zone API to get the current timezone for a location. 
Used the Google Elevation API to retrieve elevation data for a location.
